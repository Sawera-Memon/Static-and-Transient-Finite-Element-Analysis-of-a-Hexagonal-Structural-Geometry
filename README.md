# Static-and-Transient-Finite-Element-Analysis-of-a-Hexagonal-Structural-Geometry
Static and transient Finite Element Analysis of a hexagonal structural geometry to evaluate stress distribution, deformation, and time-dependent structural response. The project demonstrates the application of FEA techniques for analyzing steady and dynamic loading conditions
