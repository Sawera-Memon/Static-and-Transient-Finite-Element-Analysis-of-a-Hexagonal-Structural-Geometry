# Static-and-Transient-Finite-Element-Analysis-of-a-Hexagonal-Structural-Geometry
This repository presents a static and transient Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of a hexagonal structural geometry, conducted to investigate its stress distribution, deformation response, and dynamic behavior under time-dependent loading.

The project covers:

Geometry definition and assumptions

Material properties

Static loading and boundary conditions

Transient (time-dependent) analysis setup

Meshing strategy and solver configuration

Post-processing of stress, deformation, and structural response

This work is intended for academic and learning purposes, demonstrating both steady-state and time-dependent structural behavior using numerical simulation techniques.
